## Implementation

The application uses the google calendar api to search what events
are happening in the time frame that is specified in the check box.
The backend is done with Flask.

## Running the program

When running the program you will need to install all the dependencies
from pip, by using a virtual environment. When running the actual server
you need to be inside the meetings directory, or the credentials file
and google key file cannot be found.
